INSTALLATION

BSI makes use of a number of other libraries which need to be
installed before compiling BSI. They are all available from github:

https://github.com/mjcarley/gqr
https://github.com/mjcarley/mop
https://github.com/mjcarley/wbfmm
https://github.com/mjcarley/blaswrap

Once the required libraries are installed, the installation process is
the usual sequence:

./configure [options]
make
make install

./configure --help 

lists the options available.

It is recommended to use the highest level of compiler optimization available:

CFLAGS="-O3 -g" ./configure ...

as it does make a very noticeable difference to performance.
